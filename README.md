#Renderly : A 3D Modeling Software in C++ with Raylib

This project is a lightweight 3D modeling tool developed using C++ and Raylib, designed to provide a fundamental 3D modeling environment. The software allows users to load, view, and edit 3D models, with support for basic rendering and essential 3D transformations.

## Key Features:
- **OBJ File Loading**: Import 3D models in OBJ format.
- **Projection Modes**: View models in Perspective or Orthographic projection.
- **Rendering Styles**: Toggle between Wireframe Mode and Fill Mode (solid view).
- **Model Editing**: Modify vertex positions to edit 3D objects.
- **Export Functionality**: Export modified models for further use.

Core components such as the camera system, coordinate system, surface detection, and projection methods are implemented from scratch. Raylib is used primarily for basic pixel rendering  and some UI elements. The project emphasizes the mathematical foundations behind 3D graphics, including projection transformations, depth calculations, and rendering pipelines, providing valuable insights into the inner workings of 3D graphics without relying on high-level game engines.
